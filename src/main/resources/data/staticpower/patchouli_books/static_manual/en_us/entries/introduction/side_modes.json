Similarly, if the machine side was set to $(6)$(bold)output, $(reset)the machine would output its product into that chest."

There are only three options: $(9)$(bold)input, $(6)$(bold)output, $(reset)and $(4)$(bold)disabled. $(reset)Only batteries and other power generating machines can have their sides configured for power. All other machines accept power on all sides and do not offer the opportunty to provide power."
